Insurer challenges Judgment of High Court confirming award of Motor
Accidents Claims Tribunal directing it to pay compensation. Widow and
daughter of the deceased filed an application for compensation contending
that deceased was the Regional Manager of a Company and had died in a road
accident while travelling in a car owned by the Company and driven by a
driver employed by the Company. Insurer contended that deceased himself
was driving the car at the time of accident and that there is collusion
between claimants and owner of the vehicle. It was therefore contended that
the insurer was not liable, Tribunal directed owner of the vehicle to pay
compensation and exonerated insurer from liability as the deceased was
driving the vehicle of his employer. In appeal filed by claimants, High Court
modified the award, relying on Swaran Singh's case and directed insurer to
satisfy the award and recover it from the owner if so advised. Insurer
challenged finding of High Court contending that it had no liability in view of
the finding that the vehicle was driven by the deceased and hence decision in
Swaran Singh's case will not apply.
Allowing the appeal, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that where the policy does not cover the deceased, Insurance Company cannot be directed to satisfy the award and thereafter recover it from the owner of the vehicle;
